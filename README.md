# ResumeScreening
This project explores the process and development of an Applicant Tracking
System (ATS) for screening and ranking resumes based on their semantic similarity to a job
description and ideal resumes. In this project, we use SBERT for embeddings, cosine similarity
for filtering, and train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict binary classify candidates
based on their resumes. This document shows the results, and how we determined many of
the values/processes for our finished project.
