This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g. pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.  Designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment for a mission critical product.  Delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for more than 10 years in a row.  Built a very strong and resilient team(from 4 team members to over 50) to support huge demand for the products developed by my team. I was responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate new quality products as well as support existing products in production.  Led a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-memory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at Wellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production since 2013.  Led a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.  Due to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform. IBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure information that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data and is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and analytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud environment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.  My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due to very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from monolithic architecture to service based architecture.  Designed,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(>60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to Amazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.  Designed, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment decisions to return positive alpha for our clients. As a lead database developer, I contributed to solve database slowness problems by tuning complex database queries and improve data modeling to improve overall system performance of the system.  Designed and developed meta-data using yaml to represent complex business rules and application logic. Developed an automated process to update meta-data in yaml format using Python to improve efficiency and time to market.

933,12341902,"         EDUCATION OFFICER & SENIOR EDUCATION OFFICER GUIDANCE & COUNSELING UNIT       Professional Summary     I joined the Ministry of Education in 1982 and was posted at the R.M.Bailey Senior High School where I remained for seventeen and a half wonderful years.  I served as Head of the Guidance Department from 1991 to 1999 until my redeployment to Special Services Section to oversee the Guidance & Counseling Unit upon the retirement of the former officer.  I enjoyed my experience at R.M.Baily and have had the pleasure of working with and assisting students even after my departure from the school, I am still counseling many of them and their children today.     I have had the opportunity of supervising the Guidance & Counseling Unit over the past sixteen years and watched it grow from forty- two (42) counselors in 1999 to one hundred and thirty two (132) in 2015, posted in ninety-four schools on fourteen islands and cays throughout the country.  During my leadership, we collaborated with the College of The Bahamas and Kent State University and established a Master's of Education Degree Program in School Counseling from 2001 to 2011.  Eighty- nine (89) persons obtained the Masters Degree, and the unit has the largest amount of employees with this Degree in the Ministry of Education.   I realized in order for the unit to move forward, ongoing training was a requirement for all officers, which kept them informed about the latest techniques and strengthened areas of concern.   We also established a crisis team that assists with grief and disaster counseling.    The needs of students were being met but those of the employees were not and after visiting the school district in Dallas Texas, I learned about the Employee Assistance Program, and implemented it at the Ministry of Education on a smaller scale.  This proved to be very successful but  the need for expansion was necessary. Upon the retirement of Mrs. Pansy Hamilton Brown, Iris Strachan, and Clevette Gibson took the  reins and took EAP to the next level.  The demands on the officers made me realize that the service needed to be made available to all government employees and the idea to expand the service was decided.   I enjoyed my role as Senior Education Officer and if given the opportunity would like to be a part of taking EAP to the next level.

My Team raised the bar for the level of completion at the time of launch.  Prior ships launched at a level of mid - low 70 percentile, while LCS 9 launched at 84% complete and therefore re-gaining schedule for an on-time delivery.  This level of completion earned the Team significant accolades from the customer along with the company earning a multi-million dollar incentive bonus for achieving this goal  Introduced status boards at Work Centers to communicate performance to employees.  Additionally, we post safety alerts on status boards when accidents occur and speak to each of our crews to insure we are adhering to safe practices and alerting Leadership when they see a problem.          Director of Fabrication and Assembly   11/2012   to   06/2014     Company Name   City  ,   State       Accountable for the Construction of Modules for LCS vessels.  Responsible for the following; Structure, Pipe Fabrication, Outfitting of equipment and Electrical foundations, short and long term manning plans, and cost and schedule performance.  The Structural Trade (Steel and Aluminum) was performing at 50% productivity and losing schedule each day.  Additionally, the team was disjointed and not working as a cohesive unit.  Throughout the transition from poor performance to exceptional performance, I accomplished the following:  1) Immediately cut manning in the Steel Module department from 167 down to 127, with immediate improvement in cost performance and no degradation in schedule.  2) Continued to reduce manning through attrition and the elimination of contract employees to achieve on budget cost performance.  3) Once stabilized, schedule performance began to improve until the group was back on baseline schedule and improvements began to happen daily.  4) Built a solid Team that has continued to improve and is currently operating with 70 employees as opposed 167 and continues to gain schedule and make improvements.  Spearheaded the introduction and implementation of Lean methods.  Results to date include: Implemented 5S program with great success.Everything has a place; Everything in it's place.  Implemented Lean methods in the Pipe shop that resulted in an increased throughput from 250 spools per week 			up to just over 400 spools per week without additional manpower.  Introduced status boards at Work Centers to communicate performance to employee base.  Introduced daily tracking, progressing and daily status to each foreman in an effort to understand how we 			performed each day and what corrections must be made to insure we meet our weekly goals.  As this group stabilized, complaints from our internal customers diminished by 75%.  This was done through open communication of the down stream issues with internal customers and a ""Go and See"" technique so the foreman who performed the unacceptable work could understand how their error effected down stream operations.  Using this technique, coupled with a more clear understanding of quality procedures, quality performance improved greatly saving thousands of hours of unnecessary rework.  Highlighting safety as the most important thing we do as a Leadership Team and working with my direct reports, we managed to create a safer, cleaner and more organized environment, reducing accidents by 50 % in the first year.  This was accomplished through communication and implementation of 5S methods leading to eliminating potential safety hazards.

Pressures, temperatures, velocities among other important physical quantities were analyzed in 40 different geometries.  This project contributed with the optimization process of turbine blades and aided them to achieve higher temperature levels and efficiency.  It is not a secret in today's industry that turbine engines are able to produce extremely high inlet temperatures when they implement cooling impingement, which allow them to cool down the system without harming the performance of the engine.  Also, it allows the engine to achieve higher efficiency levels.  Upon this experiment, a research paper was written and patented.

The emergency speed of the ship was activated but that is too slow. I suggested to modified the linkage connection by using the left side terminal shaft of the governor. Then we were able to reach safely the port of Ketchikan, Alaska.    When the power turbine blades of one of our Gas Turbine Engine  were all broken, our chief Engineer asked me if we can replace it? This procedure were never done before me. I studied the video and bought a hydraulic jack and fabricate special tools so that we can separate the compressor from the combustion chamber. We recorded the hydraulic pressure when we had loosen the nut of the long stud bolt that hold the compressor and the combustion chamber, we used the same pressure when we put it back.   There was a power outage, after the resumption of the power supply we lost the program of the PLC that controls our reverse osmosis plant.Since we don't have the program, we temporary            convert the control by installing relays, magnetic contactors and           timers and rewire it so that all sensors will function to protect the           equipment and resume our much needed operation.

Accomplishments     Preformed a comprehensive Analysis of the Federal Aviation Administrations En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) upgrade    I was a member of the Independent Operational Assessment (IOA) team that performed a comprehensive Analysis of the ERAM upgrade to the National Air Space System (NAS). I performed in-depth triage of ERAM anomalies at 16 different ARTCC as an ERAM Subject Matter Expert (SME).  And at times made recommendations, for what kind of adaptations to local Automation could be made to enhance ERAMs performance at a particular facility.        Experience      Air Traffic Controller  ,   08/1983   to   12/2015    Company Name   －   City  ,   State     While working more than 32 years as an En Route Air Traffic Controller (ATCS) in the En Route environment, I maintained the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic in the NAS. I was an expert at various disciplines of air traffic control while maintaining at least the minimum separation standard's, and adhering to procedures and regulation as set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration.           04/2013   to   01/2015      Was a National En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) Subject Mater Expert (SME) and visited 16 En-Route Air Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) and identified ERAM anomalies. In addition to documenting ERAM's undesirable process, also recommending adaptation changes that resulted in the desired behavior for the affected facility. When not documenting ERAM anomalies, or consulting on ERAM work-a-rounds, I conducted training of the controllers at the sectors working traffic, concerning ERAM functionality. During my collateral duties as an IOA team member and a National ERAM SME, I was able to maintain my currency every month, and conducted OJT.            09/2008   to   04/2013      Served as a National SME on the FAA's Independent Operational Assessment (IOA) team. As a team member I collected data and collaborated on the final report concerning the operational readiness for ERAM's National Deployment.                                                         28 years of experience working transition sectors from domestic Air Traffic Services to Oceanic Air Traffic services. This airspace required manual coordination on route, altitude and time estimates with Oakland Oceanic sectors; as well as establishing oceanic separation standers for the affected flight before entering an oceanic sector. This Radar-Non Radar environment required me to correlate flight plans with incoming and outgoing tracks, and either terminate or re-identify the flight in a Radar environment.  Worked Arrival and Departure traffic In and out of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) for 32 years. This required closely working with a level 5 Approach control, facilitating the separation of aircraft during the transition phase of a flight from the terminal to the En Route environment. This requires a strong working knowledge of geography for expediting flight on their flight plans, while working within flow control restriction, weather, and volume limitations. And before the wide acceptance of GPS navigation this required long range vectoring, which required consideration of weather and traffic situations. Sequenced traffic for Seattle Approach (S46) from high sectors (above FL230) and low sectors (below FL240) as well as converging routes, in sectors that were over the Cascade Mountains, which introduced weather, and train factors.  With 28 years of experience working aircraft in a transitional phase of flight (back and forth from terminal and En Route) I have extensive knowledge and experience with different types of route structures including the new Advanced R-NAV SID's and STAR's with their descend and climb via phases of transitioning to and from the En Route to Terminal environment. As well as more conventional types of En Route navigation like Jet routs, victor airway, ""Q"" routs, ""K"" fixes, as well as point-to point GPS/RNAV/ Latitude/longitude Navigation, and conventional SID's and STAR's.  I worked daily military training flights on IR and VR routes, airspace reservation both moving ALTRAV and special Use airspace (SUA). I have experience with Naval (P3, F18, E2, A6 and EA6 aircraft, Air force (F16, F15, F4, C17, C141, KC35, B2 and B52), Army (A10, UH60, and AH64), and Air National Guard (F4, F15 and F16) and their missions. The sectors I was certified on had Naval, Air force, and Army bases and a joint civilian/Air National Guard base. My experience involves clearing fighters into and recovering fighters from special use airspace, as well as air refueling missions and helicopters for the Army back and forth from base to training grounds.  Controlled cross border flights between the USA and Canada for over 32 years. Experience includes passing manual time estimates, flight plans, and making and taking manual hand offs via voice calls. Also experience at some of the limitations of CATTS (the Canadian version of ERAM) and ERAM's interfaces are.  Have 32 years experience providing approach control services at uncontrolled, and tower controlled airports. One of the tower-controlled airports was Paine Field in Everett, WA. Pain field (PAE) is a key airport in the Boeing Company manufacturing process, and worked closely with Boeing in their testing and certification process for new airplanes. Also Pain field is an airport that many new pilots would go and do multiple practice approaches for training. This environment meant the traffic pattern at Paine field had a large variety of aircraft, Large commercial aircraft, navy fighters and small single engine trainers, this required the  separation and sequence the traffic but apply wake turbulence procedures in many instances. While providing approach control services at PAE, we meet the requirements to use 3NM separation in most of the area. This required vigilantes as to how fare the aircraft was from the RADAR antenna, and adding to the complexity of this particular airspace, was the West side was over water, or low lying land; but the train rose very quickly to the East, required different techniques for lost com or vectoring to the final approach course.  Preformed duties as a SME in Plans and Programs (ZSE-510) consulting on the feasibly of releasing equipment to Airways and Facilities for maintained.

Comments    I have been working in the Aviation industry for 12 years now and bring with me a total on 15 years of experience that makes me a well-seasoned professional. I bring with me experience of working with commercial, military, charter, and prototype aircraft. I am experienced and knowledgeable with Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, Dornier, and Lockheed and have proven myself to be both versatile when working with various aircraft makes & customers.          Experience     January 2011   to   Current     Company Name   City  ,   State     Purchaser / Production Coordinator        My journey at Flightstar began with production coordinating, where I was responsible for interfacing with leads, project managers, and customer representatives regarding aircraft documentation, parts status, and any problems that may affect the delivery schedule.  In this position I was responsible for aircraft paperwork and work cards during the maintenance visits.  I worked one on one with purchasing to ensure the proper communication of parts that could affect aircraft delivery and help expedite these parts as necessary.  When services were required either in house or items being sent out for any kind of testing or repair, I would provide complete and accurate paperwork to purchasing.  Daily reporting of parts statuses, man hours, and aircraft schedule was a daily task.  Being a coordinator first and already having experience in purchasing made my transition to a buyer smooth since I could now work more closely with the coordinators with each of us able to support one another better with part status updates and any paperwork issues.  Like coordinators I have to interface with leads, project managers, and customer representatives.  In addition I have to communicate between various departments at FAS such accounting to make sure that material is paid and billed accurately as well as quality to make sure that the parts purchase are up to standard and come from an approved source.  Being on both sides of the fence I know see that coordinators spend more time corresponding between the different areas of the job where buyers spend more time on parts themselves.  Purchasers are responsible for every part purchased or requested and Have the sole responsibility of resolving any materials needed.  I have to not only purchase the parts but also validate the paperwork or trace is acceptable and legal.  If it isn't, resolve any rejected parts by means of returns and credits.  Buyers are responsible for expediting all orders and making sure that they are received as needed.  We then report this information to the coordinators and project managers as necessary.  Outside vendor interaction is a big part of purchasing and we have to form business relationships to effectively perform or duties.  In addition I am responsible for meeting standards and performance metrics within the company to make that we are functioning at an industry standard to rise above the competition.  Purchasing is also responsible for cost savings such engaging in supplier contracts and rebate programs.  These savings of course benefits everyone on the company.  Purchasers are a point of contact between FAS, suppliers, and customers regarding materials so effective communication and reporting is key in this position.         February 2009   to   December 2010     Company Name   City  ,   State     Purchasing Clerk / Material Specialist        Working with Vision Airlines included a lot of different     responsibilities.  Not only was I responsible for quoting and purchasing materials for both Aircraft and Stock, but also included Stores / Warehouse, Shipping, and Receiving responsibilities.  Being a smaller Airline I work closely with the Executive staff as well as the owners of the company themselves.  After receiving a Material Order Request, I would acquire the necessary quotes to find the best price and lead time available.  If needed, get approval to proceed with the order.  Coordinate and expedite the shipping and payment process to get the material where it needs to be in a timely manner.  I would match invoice with purchase orders and track shipments to assure their arrival.  Upon receipt of material, I then would verify proper certification of the material, receive into the system, and label as required.  Once material is ready to be used, issue from the system to assure all records was correct.  All of this required constant tracking using Excel, Word, and Adobe.  I kept records of all transactions whether it was materials needing to be ordered, Purchase Orders themselves, Invoices needing to be paid, or items that that have already been received.  As well as certifications and any other information requested from maintenance.  If an item needed to be shipped I was responsible for the proper packaging, handling, and traceability to be done in a professional manner.  As part of the AOG team I would be called on at any time to locate and facilitate the material where the urgent requirement may be.  This involved having key information to acquire the material and coordinate with the proper logistics necessary.  Also as a valued member of the material group I have represented the Airline at maintenance facilities to properly manage the material being ordered and used for an Aircraft.         February 2005   to   January 2009     Company Name   City  ,   State     Purchasing Agent / Material Expeditor        I started working as a Material Expeditor which required me to work closely with Purchasing, Maintenance, and the Airline.  Being an Expeditor had responsibilities that could change day by day depending on what was required of me.  I provided daily reports and expedited any material needed to keep the production process flowing efficiently.  This meant coordinating the order and shipment process, as well as the actual delivery of the material.  My responsibility as a Purchasing Agent is to find price and availability on material needed and then order and track for prompt shipment.  This requires me to deal directly with the vendors and develop relationships for future business.  I also retrieve any and all paperwork required, retrieving certification, submit any and all signatures necessary, and expedite the material in a timely fashion.  Once I have received the material I then facilitate and expedite the flow of materials to and from various departments.  I have worked with many different Airline companies as well as Military, which all have high and demanding standards to meet.  With this job no two days are the same, it is a constant change with challenging obstacles.  In addition to being a Buyer and Expeditor, I was responsible for doing spare Sales to sister and contract companies.  This required the technique of verifying stock, quoting material, ensuring proper certification, and shipping.  Between the three job functions I was constantly providing and coordinating AOG orders support.  Clientlogic (DELL).          Education     1/2010     Transportation        Dangerous Goods
