My responsibilities involved creating a design that would clearly express the beliefs of the Walk for Suicide event, state information such as the event time and address, and to intrigue the eye and to create interest overall. The event was something I believed to be very important so I took my time on creating the design which took a 2 days, with my ability to create and deliver in a timely manner.

My first volunteer job there was a greeter for everyone who had entered the fair, I was to record who came into the park, asking for any donations, and if they wanted to participate in the races or raffles. As the fair days progressed and my skills had shown to improve around the fair goers, I was upgraded to a waiter at many of the stands that were around to sell food. I up-sold the menu items, and beverages to increase the profits that would go towards donations for the dogs. I took the necessary steps to meet customer needs and to resolve any food or service issues.

We went through the steps of designing and computer modeling of new spaces, the ordering of top quality materials and fixtures, to overseeing the scheduling and workmanship of installers.  In the summer of 2009, I worked in East Hampton, New York at the Grand Acquisitor, an upscale Antique Dealer.  The store specialized in antiques such as; decorative accessories, lace, linens, silver, and furniture.  The key to succeeding in the antiques business is knowledge.  I was able to see 18th and 19th century furniture, clothes, accessories, and more.  Here I learned purchasing skills and the ability to spot a good find.  I also recorded and kept track of the inventory as well as helped in setting up displays.

Skills Used Business, design & sales skills   This retail store was a newest branch of an old, well established, family owned chain of stores from the east side of the state.  The family had recently hired a new, young general manager.  He was responsible, apparently, for some poor management decisions, resulting in the parent company going into bankruptcy and all stores being shut down.        06/1991   to   09/1994     Owner/Manager      Company Name   –   City  ,   State    Converted 7500 square feet of commercial space into 24 individual offices of varying sizes, several cubicle spaces, large and small conference rooms, reception area, secretarial work area and lounge.

Building was sold in 1993 and new owner had other plans for the space and refused to renew the lease.  I had moved the business once and paid for build-out of this space.  I couldn't afford to move again; decided to close business instead.        Current     Principal      Company Name   –   City  ,   State      Consulted with clients to determine architectural preference to meet overall design goals.

Interfaced with architects, contractors, sub-contractors, consultants, fabricators, and regulatory agencies.  Specified proper products and materials for each project.  Prepared construction documents and details to implement design concepts.   Established at the time of graduation from design school, I began my independent career, on a full-time basis.  When business was slow (due to recession, etc.) I accepted employment with well established firms.  I have continued to serve many repeat clients and referrals over the years.       Transitional Vocation    In 1981, before the advent and common use of CAD programs, I had a serious injury to my right (drawing) hand.  I was owner of income properties and had been managing income propertiesfor other individual owners.  Since I was not going to be able to use my hand again for drawing for some time, I took a position as a manager of a 160 unit apartment project that was only 50% occupied.  Within six months, all units were rehabbed, rentable and occupied, and 95-100% occupancy was maintained while I was manager.    In 1983, I was offered a position with another firm as Project Manager during construction and Start-Up Manager of a 360 unit apartment complex.  Being involved at the inception, I was able to revise apartment floor plans to made accommodation for the most common objections I heard while marketing existing floor plans.  My revised plans were very successful and apartments were filled as fast as they were built, with a long waiting list.  Approximately 1/3 of the tenants from the first project I had managed, moved to the new complex, which was extremely gratifying.  I continued in this position to the end of construction.  During that time, I attended property management courses and earned a Residential Property Management Certificate.  My hand was rehabilitated by this time and I decided it was time to return to my real passion, interior design.        Education     1970     Associate of Arts  :   architectural/interior design     New York School of Interior Design   -   City  ,   State      Architecture and interior design history   Fine arts history   Color theory and application   Light theory and application   Textiles  Upholstery  Window treatments  Paint, surface textures, wallcoverings  Interior building materials  Architectural drawing and perspective rendering  Business and marketing principles for designers    All courses were taught by professionals in their respective fields with years of practical experience.         1967     Associate of Arts  :   business principles and skills     Lansing Business University (Davenport Business College)   -   City  ,   State      Basic business management principles  Business law  Office management    Accounting/bookkeeping  Office skills (typing, shorthand, business machines, etc.)  Business etiquette           Skills    Accounting, advertising, Basic, business law, business writing, computer aided design, Color, com, client, clients, drafting, Edit, email, Interior Design, marketing, Materials, window, rendering, retail, sales skills, sales, shorthand, space-planning, specification, phone, typing   ",DESIGNER

Together, the GATE identified students and I, created a school newspaper. We named it the Jr Journal and invented five topics that would be in every issue. I helped create an outline and template that our reporters could follow and eventually do independently. Each student chose a different topic every month and would either interview or research to write an article for that section. They would then write a rough draft, that I would edit, and then they would type the final draft and put it into the newspaper template. Students would also have a chance to find graphics or take pictures that fit their topic. It turned out great and we were able to publish four issues. This will be our second year. This was a great accomplishment for me as an educator, because I love to write and was in my school newspaper in High School. I had the chance to share a passion of mine and see students enjoy coming in after school and put their advanced brains to work. It was such a great experience and can't wait to have that again this year.    ",TEACHER

Certification (K-5), makes me a worthy contender for a teacher position at your school .Utilizing my skills and expertise, I am eager to become a key member of your team.
As specified in the enclosed resume, I offer you the following attributes in order to contribute to your ongoing success:

Uses effective and efficient methods of teaching while focusing on the individual needs of each student.          Highlights          Central Missouri Math Educators club member  Missouri Council of Teachers of Mathematics 2014 Conference      Tutoring experience  MS Office proficient  Organized   Timely             Accomplishments     While working for Beauty Brands I received two awards. I received the Award of Excellence and Shift Manager of the Year. The Award of Excellence is a company wide award and is awarded to one person from each district. Out of seven locations I was chosen for my district. I was presented the award at Beauty Brands annual banquet in Kansas City. I accepted the award from the founder and CEO and was recognized in front of all of home office, location managers, and other award winners. The next year I was awarded with Shift Manager of the Year for my district.         Experience     I have a little over 100 hours of observation and participation field experience. Sixty hours of my field experience are observations from algebra I at Lees Summit High School summer school and 6th grade math and social studies at Brittany Hill. Fifteen hours were spent at Holden Middle School tutoring 6th through 8th graders in various contents. I spent twelve hours observing special education students in both a general education and special education classrooms. I finished about twenty hours in a 6th grade math class at Grain Valley South Middle School. One of my peers and I taught three different lessons and led several small groups in discussions about various math articles. One lesson we taught was reviewing order of operations. Since the students were newly familiar with the information we wanted them to get some practice working on various problems using multiple operations. We played “I have, who has?” As each student read their equation to the class I would write it on the board so that they could visualize it and write it down.

This position required coordinating with IS Leadership at our corporate parent, Community Health Systems, and balancing the same with local Administration.  Early in my tenure, we were able to develop a new level of communication and cooperation between Nursing, Financial, Administration, Physicians, IS and CHS Corporate.  I sat on a number of committees both within the company and the community to maintain the cooperation that allowed us to advance.  In addition to successfully developing and mentoring an exceptional IS team of 6 during my two years in this position, we implemented the first three phases of Electronic Medical Record through the hospital and owned physician offices, completed a new data center implementation, conversion to fiber backbone communications and digital phone system, Windows 7 upgrade for over 800 users and total systems upgrades in the clinical departments.  This facility was shifted to a higher level within the CHS network of 250 hospitals and awarded numerous national accolades from third-parties due to some of the changes made by my department and team.

This facility was shifted to a higher level within the CHS network of 250 hospitals and awarded numerous national accolades from third-parties due to some of the changes made by my department and team. I was brought into South Baldwin Regional Medical Center as the facility's first IS-based PACS Administrator.  After initial reorganization of the PACS environment and creation of PACS related support procedures and documentation, my responsibilities quickly expanded to IS projects where I identified productivity improvements that could be made.  Some of these projects included: Becoming the 24/7 dedicated technical resource for all Radiology functions, meaningful use implementation coordination, fileserver redesign for more stable and productive use, network and system optimizations where needed to improve efficiency, outlying clinic improvements to encourage ""single-company"" relations, and a number of others where needed.  My primary focus has always been providing the necessary tools and support for the constant improvement of patient care.        Manager, ImageLink PACS   City  ,   State    Company Name  /   Jun 2006   to   Jul 2011     My hiring position at CPSI was as a Senior Project Manager in the ITS Special Projects division.  After only 3 months in this position, I was recruited into the ImageLink PACS division as an Implementation Project Manager.  Before being promoted to Assistant Manager then Manager of this division, my primary responsibilities were system install scheduling, preparation and complete onsite implementation.  The three week onsite implementation of the ImageLink system entailed; coordinating server placement and networking with hospital IT, directing the installation of all server and reading hardware, coordination with all modality vendors to establish DICOM communication with the new system, integration with CPSI and other vendor HIS, Radiologist and staff training  and conversion of data from the previous Radiology system.  A number of these sites requested that we perform the conversion of data without involving the previous vendor.  Success in these situations required developing an in-depth familiarity with numerous systems, including: McKesson, GE Centricity, Philips iSite, OrthoView, E-Film and Spectra PACS systems. Because responsibilities included development planning with Programming and travel with Sales to assist in promoting the ImageLink product, I acquired additional familiarity with these competitor systems in order to keep ImageLink current with the needs of our customers and provide my employees with training relevant to their implementations.  This broad spectrum of involvement with multiple PACS systems left me knowledgeable on their use, tools and configuration.
CPSI of Mobile
In September 2006, ImageLink was in use at 27 of CPSI's 950 hospitals nationwide.  Of the 101 sites added during my time in ImageLink, I implemented 58, either directly or in an onsite supervisory capacity while retaining ultimate responsibility for all installs and the overall performance of the division and its employees.

My efforts in this position resulted in a 60% increase in employee productivity and the development of the first Private Label Auction site, for one of our key clients, creating the first source of income from the ICS Department.  Spending in the ICS Department was decreased by more than $100,000. I was hired into this position as the direct assistant to the Vice President over the ICS (Information and Communication Services) Department.

2130,13727873,"         MARKET ANALYST PROMOTED TO ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF BRAND STRATEGY       Professional Summary    Dear Cristina and team,
The second I found out about this position, my I found myself extremely excited. I knew right away this is something I have to be a part of, and something I'd deeply regret if I didn't try.

I see that in the Customer Marketing Coordinator position, and couldn't be more excited for this opportunity. 
Before Zendesk, I was at a marketing company supporting the entire staff with demographic research for target market campaigns. I enjoyed the marketing aspect and always thought I'd find myself back in it somehow. Now, I consider myself lucky to be a part of this amazing company, I've put my best effort into everything given to me and I know Zendesk is the only place I want to be. I am responsible for coordinating every interview within the San Francisco office, greeting all candidates onsite, and maintaining an organized status database.

What I love most about Recruiting is how much personable interaction there is on a daily basis with different backgrounds and different personalities. I've had the privilege of being trained to always have a poised and appropriate response to every situation, and guidelines for the utmost professionalism with every phone screen, reference call, email, or in-person interview. I recently had the opportunity to visit college campuses to promote Zendesk. I realized then how much I enjoy educating others and making them too, believe in what we do. 
Now that I've found the perfect company, I'm ready for the perfect position that combines everything I love and excel in; planning, coordinating and evangelizing. With my history in Marketing and my current role, I'm used to supporting an entire team and an entire company. I can manage multiple projects at once, I'm highly dependable and extremely detailed. Zendesk has made me a more passionate professional and I would love the opportunity to promote our vision for customer love. Best regards,

2268,31114531,"         DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMMING ARTS       Professional Profile     Tech-savvy Performing Arts Director well-versed in all aspects of event management from inception to completion. Excels in marketing and talent programming, as well as process rethinking and improvement.        Qualifications          Productivity improvement  Detail-oriented  Superb time management skills  Process improvement      Multi-unit operations management  Natural leader  Unsurpassed work ethic  Results-oriented            Relevant Experience    In my time as the Director of
Programming Arts at DSU, I have drastically improved the bottom line of
shows at the Cox Performing Arts Center and the Tanner Amphitheater and have simultaneously created and funded
permanent improvements and endowments. The Trailblazer Summer Concert Series at
the Tanner went from consistently losing money to net profit in both 2015 and
2016.

By changing the way tickets are
marketed, I was able to generate a 30% increase in season ticket memberships to the Celebrity Concert Series in only one year. I have also created a scholarship
program for College of the Arts students at DSU which financially supported
twelve students in 2016. I sought and obtained donations from the community in
order to completely renovate the Cox Center's Green room and made permanent
improvements to the aesthetics of the stage at Tanner Amphitheater including
adding shade to the performing area as well as new lighting and sound
equipment. All of this was completed without receiving any additional funding from the University.      Experience     03/2014   to   Current     Director of Programming Arts    Company Name   －   City  ,   State    As the Director of Programming Arts
at Dixie State University, I am responsible for the cultural arts activities at
multiple venues. The Cox Performing Arts Center (1200 seats) is the home of the Celebrity
Concert Series (CCS) which has been the premier performing arts series in
the area since 1958. I am responsible for the management of the CCS and
my duties include overseeing all programming, marketing, hospitality, financial accounts, administration, and
fulfillment. I am also responsible for interacting with and guiding the
CCS Board of Directors comprised of community leaders and performing arts
enthusiasts. The CCS plays host to a wide variety of entertainment genres.
Our current season includes Manhattan Transfer with Take 6, the Utah Symphony,
The Drifters, GENTRI, and Canadian Brass to name a few.

I am also responsible, during the
summer months, for all facets of programming and management of the Tanner
Amphitheater (1600 seats) in Springdale, Utah at the entrance to Zion National Park. Before
I came to DSU, this outdoor theater was used for a handful of local artists
playing weekend shows on a bare stage. I have completely rethought this venue
by adding visual design elements, incorporating concessions and catering,
seeking and obtaining permits to serve alcohol, and structuring the programming
around two series formats. The first series is comprised of festival-style events where each
performance date is focused on a specific genre of music and marketed as a
standalone event with multiple artists hired for each show. The results have been miraculous as we turned a poorly attended series into an important,
well-attended festival that was supported both by the community and the
tourists staying in Springdale as part of their vacation to Zion National
Park. 

The second series is an original
show called, ""Sanctuary: The Story of Zion"" which was written to
correspond with the centennial celebration of our National Parks. I co-created,
produced, and directed the show as well as assembled and hired the performance
and tech team. This show was based on feedback we received from the area
business owners when asked what kind of entertainment would best be supported by
the tourists who come to the area. Sanctuary tells the story of Zion National
Park though storytelling, music, and the unique usage of video projection to
share testimonials of many prominent Zion Park officials as well as world-class
artists and climbers who call Zion home.       01/2010   to   Current     Board of Directors Member    Company Name   －   City  ,   State    SUSWA continues to be a creative force in the Southern

we create and manage multiple concert series each year in St George, Utah.       01/1994   to   03/2015     Operations Manager    Company Name   －   City  ,   State    As Operations Manager/Owner of
Spiral Studios, I was responsible for the daily management of a busy commercial
recording studio. From serving area musicians in a state-of-the-art studio, to
creating production music that has been featured on such networks as Discovery,
Disney, A&E, and many others, I managed each of these activities along with
a talented staff of creative minded engineers and musicians. 

Spiral Studios has also been
involved with many festival-style shows by hiring and managing artists and providing A/V equipment.  In my time at Spiral Studios, I was able
to create many industry relationships with both entertainers and
management.  These relationships have
allowed for a deep understanding of performing arts from the perspective of an
entertainer as well as a director.  This
knowledge informs my decisions and gives me a unique perspective in my role as Director of
Programming.  I continue to own Spiral Studios but have turned day-to-day operations over to a studio manager and a staff of creative engineers.       01/1994   to   Current     Musician    Company Name   －     State    As a touring/performing musician, I have had the opportunity to travel the world.  This musical ability has been the backbone of my career as I have transitioned from performing to audio engineering to managing performing arts facilities and concert series.  This experience allows the unique position of a deep understanding of multiple sides of the industry.  As I communicate with touring musicians, I have an intimate knowledge of the challenges they face.  I completely understand the technical demands and needs of the events I manage.  Lastly, I have a firm grasp on marketing and management, which has been central to my 25  year career.

I believe it is crucial for students to develop critical thinking skills as they develop their sense of self and their worldview. I prioritize teacher collaboration to develop a community among educators and to develop best practices. I pursue professional development opportunities to better serve all of my students with an emphasis on equity, differentiation and inquiry-based learning.

In my time at Lakes, I have taught 9th grade, 11th grade and 12th grade English as well as AP Literature and AP Language. Due to some teacher turnover and the adapting needs of the English department, I have had the opportunity to build my experience across grade levels and develop curriculum after curriculum to suit the needs of students at various ages. As a result, I believe one of my greatest strengths is my understanding of the skills necessary at each grade level for students to successfully exist high school career or college-ready.         06/2016   to   06/2017     Head Of English Department    Company Name   －   City  ,   State    For the past two years I have served as the English Department Head. This position required planning and scheduling of monthly departmental meetings, allocation of department funds, participation in the District Literacy Committee and disseminating information from administration to English teachers, and vice versa. To better serve the English department, I initiated monthly meetings with our Principal, Mrs. Mauer-Smith, to plan department meetings. Additionally, teachers were invited monthly to contribute agenda items or areas of professional development interest to inform these meetings and make them as meaningful as possible.       07/2016   to   06/2017     ASB Advisor    Company Name   －   City  ,   State    I was very excited to accept the position as the ASB Advisor at Lakes High School.

I saw my role as advisor to highlight student abilities, passions and ideas to build beautiful products while teacher students the value of understanding the process by which products come to be.

The biggest improvements I made were things that save them money.  The martial arts school I work at used a website that charged them $300 a month for information that was just not needed and therefore a waste of money.  I came up with our own in house system.  I identified what information (tuition, attendance, rank, student's info etc.) we needed on a daily basis, and how to get to that information quickly.  I simply used the excel program, came up with a sheet for each class and modify it to be easy to use for anyone.  We can access any information we need quickly and timely; without paying this website.  We were paying a lot for internet and phone.  I called around and verified price and contract for a commercial account.  I was able to negotiate a great price and bundle our services.  We sell a lot of merchandise at the martial arts gym.  I set up all new whole sale accounts; for equipment and uniform needs.  I researched pricing for equipment, uniforms and office needs (ink, paper, paper towels) and modified our suppliers.  I was able to establish new relationships and new pricing.  The dojo relocated in 2016.  When we took over a new space; I planned everything.  The bathroom remodel I came up with the complete redesign and ,some of the construction, I actually did myself.  I handled every aspect of moving from one location to a new location.  In a time limit of 14 days, we not only moved but opened our doors at new location; all during Christmas/New Year Holiday.  Since working for ATA, I have revised the way we communicate to students and parents.  I updated our facebook web page, came out with a monthly newsletter, put in place an announcement board, and update our webpage bi-weekly.  I have planned and executed new rank testings, tournaments, birthday parties, and planned our company events for an entire year in advance.  I have increased customer satisfaction and supported customers in areas such as conflict resolution in tuition issues, problem solved our cancel and hold policy, resolved our turnaround time on merchandise orders, clarified rules and equipment requirements in writing and revamped our leadership program.  I manage new student recruitment, marketing needs, student registration, community outreach, parent communications, staff management, ordering supplies, bookkeeping, upgrade selling, and receiving payments Improved family and parent relations for the school.  I created and implemented new schedule, new calendar of events, worked closely with the owners to design and publish the company's website Handles all record keeping (testing, contracts, tuition payments, and inventory).
