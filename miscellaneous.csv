Experience      Company Name    City  ,   State    Sushi Chef   10/2014   to   Current       Working at Wasabi's Downtown entailed the same tasks a sushi chef as Sushi Time, only I am now second chef instead of head chef. I feel like I am again coming to the point where I would like a new opportunity to start from the bottom as I have done in the past at Sushi Time and The 5 Spot.         Company Name    City  ,   State    Dishwasher/ Line Cook   04/2014   to   10/2014      Working at The 5 Spot was a really awesome experience for me. It provided some of the more conventional style kitchen and line cook experience that I had not so much been exposed to at Sushi Time. I also started off at the dishwashing position here. Although I was only there for a short period of time, the exposure to this type of kitchen environment was something that I had been missing in my culinary experience. It also posed a challenge for me since I have been mostly making sushi for the better part of the last few years. The 5 Spot was a highly fast-paced neighborhood kitchen. So, you had to be quick all around and good knife skills are a must. I really enjoyed the challenge of once again having to start all over from the bottom and work my way back up. I ended up leaving The 5 Spot due to constant management changes and an offer to work for my old boss again.         Company Name    City  ,   State    Host, Server, Dishwasher, Cook   03/2008   to   03/2014      Sushi Time Towa is the first restaurant i have worked for. I have been employed by Sushi Time for six years where I started at the very bottom and worked my way to the top. I have worked as a host and as a server which consisted of me greeting customers, helping them to their seats, grabbing their drinks and orders and doing my best to give them the utmost service and keep a smile on their face. I worked as a host/server for about a year, so most of my time has really been spent working in the kitchen and making sushi. In order for me to work my way up through the ranks to sushi, I started at the very bottom in the dish pit. This consisted of me washing all dishes, pots, pans, and silverware. I was also required to prep meats and veggies. Having started at the dish/prep position, these tasks really helped me build a strong work ethic and develop great knife skills as well. I then moved over to cooking which consisted of still participating with prep work, but also cooking and frying all orders. Prep consisted of cutting chicken, beef, shrimp, squid, and all types of veggies. I have been doing sushi now for 3 years. That is, Monday-Saturday 10-10, give or take a few hours. I have had random days off here and there and some holidays, but for the most part 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. I have developed such a passion for food and seeing a smile on a person's face when they bite into the food and love it. I love being in an environment conducive for success and working hard while loving what I do. Being a sushi chef at Sushi Time consists of a wide range of tasks. I've received serve safe managerial training, so I am in charge of making sure everything is clean and up to code. I'm also in charge of going over inventory; ranging from paper/plastics, to all meats and veggies, also drinks and alcohol. This task also means I must handle all ordering trough the different distributors and vendors we may use.

Personal Information     Lakeland College Kirtland, OH, United States Although it is not a degree for the culinary field, I have been able to apply this degree to my career and it has helped me along in my career obtain various management positions within the culinary field, which I have excelled in in my nine plus years of this profession. My goal is to one day become an executive chef and I feel at this point I will reach it one day soon. Cooking has become a strong passion of mine to where cooking jobs do not feel like jobs anymore, its more like a fun way to live my life day to day able to wake up excited to go learn new cooking skills and make people excited about visiting our restaurant, well which ever one I am working in at the time. High School Diploma: Culinary Arts (Vocational School at Beechwood High School) 2005 Charles F Brush          Lyndhurst, OH, United States While attending Brush High School (My high School) I also attended Beechwood High School from my Junior year (11th Grade) to my senior Year (12th Grade) to study culinary arts where we learned the basics of cooking. I was interested in how to become a cook and how to make various dishes so I would e able to cook meals for my family at home. During high school, although I was in the Culinary Arts program, at the time it did not keep my interest, so when I graduated I got into the Business management field, while attending college I began working as a dishwasher at Houlihans and was intrigued again by working in the kitchen, so much that I was able to be promoted to prep cook and from there I started my Culinary Career. Each year they have it here in Cleveland, and if I am Available, I work at our annual Air show as a cook vendor if there is an opportunity for me. I also like to volunteer to cook for the homeless at our Cleveland Food Bank, during the holidays which I have not been able to do recently, but I do love being able to put smiles on everyone during the holidays with exceptional and delightful meals.
